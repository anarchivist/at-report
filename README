== Reporting Application for Archivist's Toolkit

Very simple reporting application for connecting to an existing MySQL database
that is running Archivist's Toolkit, and executing pre-defined reports.

== Setup

Edit config/initializers/at_connect.rb as needed.  I recommend using a different
MySQL username than for your standard AT application and giving that user only
SELECT privileges.
